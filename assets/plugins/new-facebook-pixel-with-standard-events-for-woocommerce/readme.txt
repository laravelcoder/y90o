Insert the New Facebook Pixel to ALL your pages with one plugin

== Description ==

This plugin will solve your pixel problem in 1 minute. Set your Facebook Pixel ID, and all your WooCommerce events will be handled on autopilot.
Forever Free, there is no PRO version, there is no other fees, all features included.
Imporant: In 2016, Facebook will retire the old Facebook pixel, so this free plugin will be inevitable!
We also struggled setting up the new Facebook Pixels on our WooCommerce sites. We wanted to create a dynamic and scalable solution so we built our WordPress plugin. After a few weeks, we realized that there is a demand on a free plugin which helps you tracking your events on autopilot. So we decided to make available for everyone, for free. There are no hidden fees, no monthly fees, this plugin is forever free, all features included.
